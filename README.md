Experiments on auxiliary learning

This repository includes the code and the experimental results corresponding to this blog post: [Learning through Auxiliary Tasks](https://vivien000.github.io/blog/journal/learning-though-auxiliary_tasks.html).

The notebooks can be directly opened in Google Colab with the following links:
